      "At PlaySimple, I craft scalable data visualization solutions, with a strong focus on interactive charts and dashboards. My work spans building multi-visualization dashboards that cut analysis time by 30%, implementing versioning in charts for greater flexibility, and leading the migration from CRA to Vite, which reduced hot reloads from 10s to under 1s and build times by 80%. Alongside visualization, I’m passionate about web performance and love optimizing applications to run faster and smoother.",
